                            face. <br> Begin by acknowledging every emotion, including difficult emotions, rather than<br>
                            avoiding them. Speaking up for yourself, limiting <br>self-criticism, and other strategies can
                            help build <br> emotional strength and confidence. </p>

                        <h5>Importance of Self-Study</h5>
                        <p>Learners who engage in self-study have the  opportunity <br>to enhance their learning experience 
                            and <br> improve their studying skills. The learning method encourages <br>learners to go beyond what
                            is available to them <br> in their textbooks and what is taught to them by <br>their instructors.

                            If the student has a specific topic they want to  <br>dive deeper into, they have the freedom to
                            explore <br> that subject even more. They can focus on their <br>interests and develop stronger study
                            skills as a result. <br> Self-study is also flexible enough to consider the motivation <br>of the
                            learner as well as their time and resources. <br>This is especially helpful for younger learners
                            as in the end,<br> the learner not only gains new knowledge on that specific subject, <br> but
                            self-studying helps build on real-world <br> life skills for kids early on.</p>

                            education, and help shape the new ideas and perspectives <br>that are central to a creative and
                            innovative society.</p>
